A guided project from Datacamp - When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?

"In this project, you'll analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. You'll search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and you'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

Your search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. You'll also filter, group, and order data. Make sure you brush up on these skills before trying this project!

Our database contains two tables. We've limited each table to 400 rows for this project, but you can find the complete dataset with over 13,000 games on Kaggle."
